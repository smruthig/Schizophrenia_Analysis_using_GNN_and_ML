The research paper can be found at [this link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12868-023-00841-0).  
  
The data can be found at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gNZOscYTzWxbGBtgI3Au3NiWDWOYHUpK).  
  
Ensure that you have installed the colab plugin on your google account if you want to run the code on google colab. To run the code on google colab, first right-click on the folder and select add shortcut to drive. After that, simply open and run any of the files. All the required package installations have been included in the code.

In order to run the code locally or in a virtual environment, the paths have to be changed accordingly. For example- `/content/drive/MyDrive/SUPPLEMENTARY CODE/Data/Metadata/phenotypic_data.csv` would change to `/SUPPLEMENTARY CODE/Data/Metadata/phenotypic_data.csv`. If absolute paths are required for the environment, add the required prefix before the modified path.

If you want to run the code locally on your system, create a virtual environment using Anaconda and run the requirements.txt file.

The preprocessed data is sufficient to run the given code files. However, the original data can be obtained from the UCLA repository.
